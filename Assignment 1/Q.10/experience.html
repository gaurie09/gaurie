            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>During my studies at the Institute of Engineering and Technology, Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya, I've gained a variety of experiences that have expanded my skills in technology, design, and leadership.

</p>
<p>I completed an internship where I was responsible for creating standard data format pages for marketing campaigns. This internship helped me understand client collaboration, and gave me hands-on experience with company's environment.

</p>
<p>To enhance my knowledge of technology, I took a course in machine learning, which covered topics like neural networks, data analysis, and supervised learning. This course allowed me to explore the exciting world of artificial intelligence.

</p>
<p>I also completed a course in web development, where I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This broadened my technical skills and introduced me to building interactive websites.

</p>
<p>These experiences have shaped my approach to technology and design, and I look forward to applying my skills to new challenges and opportunities.
